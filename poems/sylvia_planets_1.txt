planet earth is the world's most powerful dish
the universe itself is very obvious
have you ever seen a giant fish
its a giant planet, mars was so serious

the dwarf gave me a strange alien look
it was dark, but the moon was very powerful indeed
the sun was just beginning to close the book
the moon illuminated the sky with lightning speed
